## About Me

Hi! My name is Elijah *(any/all)*, I am a student in San Francisco State Mathmeatics department where I am advised by [Emily Clader](https://sites.google.com/site/emilyclader/home). Our recent work generalizes known combinatorial results about boundary strata in the moduli space of genus-zero curves to the genus-one setting using sign-reversing involutions.
